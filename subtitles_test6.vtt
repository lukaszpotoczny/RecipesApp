We are living in a world where things are not the way we want. We are living in a world where things are not the way we want. We are living in a world where things are not the way we want. We are living in a world where things are not the way we want. We are living in a world where things are not the way we want.

We are living in a world where things are not the way we want.

3
00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:18.025 region:fred
We are getting a system.

4
00:00:18.065 --> 00:00:23.890 region:fred
We're getting a world which is unequal, which is sexist, which is racist.

5
00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.312 region:fred
We have systems that are discriminating against people.

6
00:00:26.332 --> 00:00:29.874 region:fred
Our climate, our environment is at risk.

7
00:00:30.355 --> 00:00:31.836 region:fred
And there's so much that needs to be done.

8
00:00:33.237 --> 00:00:38.939 region:fred
I hope that young people, they stand up, they raise their voices, they start their activism right now.

9
00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:40.420 region:fred
Let your age not stop you.

10
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.141 region:fred
Oftentimes we're told that, you know, you have to be 40 and 50 to change the world.

11
00:00:44.261 --> 00:00:45.322 region:fred
I do not believe in that.

12
00:00:45.682 --> 00:00:48.943 region:fred
I think you can be a change maker right now if you are 11, if

13
00:00:48.983 --> 00:00:53.765 region:fred
you are 16, if you are, you know, 30, 40, change is possible anytime.

14
00:00:53.945 --> 00:00:56.846 region:fred
And I want you to believe in yourself and make this world a

15
00:00:57.047 --> 00:01:00.548 region:fred
fairer, more equal and a better place for each and every one.
